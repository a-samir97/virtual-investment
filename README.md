# Virtual Investment Portfolio Management Task

## Description 
Each client should have some balance in their virtual investment portfolios. Gain
and loss of clients should be calculated based on the difference between purchase
and current prices of stocks. Each purchase should be deducted from the clientâ€™s
balance. There is no need to store unit price change logs for any stock.
